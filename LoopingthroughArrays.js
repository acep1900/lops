/*Write a for loop that iterates through our vacationSpots array using i as the iterator variable.

Inside the block of the for loop, use console.log() to log each element in the vacationSpots array after the string 'I would love to visit '. For example, the first round of the loop should print 'I would love to visit Bali' to the console.

When writing/changing loops, there is a chance that our stopping condition isnâ€™t met and we get a dreaded infinite loop which essentially stops our programming from running anything else! To exit out of an infinite loop in an exercise, refresh the page - then fix the code for your loop.*/


const vacationSpots = ['Bali', 'Paris', 'Tulum'];

// Write your code below
for (let i = 0; i < vacationSpots.length; i++){
  console.log('I would love to visit '+ vacationSpots[i])
};
